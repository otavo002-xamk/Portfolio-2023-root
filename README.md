I made this so you can run my Portfolio 2023 front-end, back-end and tests in containers in the same network. If you want to build the images locally you have to add those repositories in this folder and then comment out the image-line from each service in the docker-compose file and also uncomment the build-line.

Use the command 'docker-compose up' to create the containers.
